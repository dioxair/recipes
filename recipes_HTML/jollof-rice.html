            Mix well. Cook until chicken starts sticking to the bottom, about 5 minutes.
            Pour in water, mix, cover the pot, and bring to a gentle simmer; cook for 15 minutes.
            Remove from heat.</li>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <li>Transfer chicken to a baking dish using a slotted spoon.
            Strain cooking liquid through a fine-mesh sieve.
            Reserve 1 1/2 cups liquid. Discard solids.</li>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <li>Bake chicken in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the middle and the juices run clear, about 30 minutes.
            An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <li>Heat 3 tablespoons vegetable oil in a large pot over medium-low heat and cook 1/2 onion until soft and translucent but not browned, about 5 minutes.
            Add tomato sauce; cook and stir until slightly thickened and infused into the oil, 5 to 7 minutes.</li>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <li>Stir reserved chicken broth, coconut milk, 1 teaspoon herbes de Provence, salt, and pepper into the pot. <!-- ????????????? WHAT DOES IT MEAN??? OIWDWSBDNJCVSFDJK -->
            Bring to a simmer; add rice.
            Cook, stirring often, until rice is almost tender, 15 to 20 minutes.
            Add frozen vegetables and continue cooking until rice is tender and creamy, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <li>Heat 1/2 cup of canola oil in a nonstick pan over medium heat.
            Add plantains and fry on both sides until golden and crispy, about 2 to 3 minutes per side.
            Drain on paper towels. Garnish jollof rice with friend plantains and serve with chicken.</li>
